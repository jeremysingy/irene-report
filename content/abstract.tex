Recovery of old records using optical technologies is used for years by Carl Haber and his team at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). So far, a lot of them have already been restored using systems based on 2D or 3D scanning for the acquisition and programs that use the result to get the original sound. However, some of these records are heavily damaged making them difficult to process. A common issue is when the lacquer layer shrinks resulting in so-called cracked records. This project aims to find solutions in order to process different types of these records, whether using user input and control or in a more automatic way. TODO summarize results
