\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}

Firstly, I would like to thank my responsible professors, Messrs. Ottar Johnsen and Frédéric Bapst. They made possible this unique opportunity of a great experience, working for almost six months in the famous Berkeley Lab in the USA. Moreover, Mr. Johnsen was a precious help for technical difficulties in the signal processing field, while Mr. Bapst kept a careful look at the project and at my numerous typos in this report.

A special thank goes to Carl Haber, without whom this thesis would not have been possible, and who brought ideas and suggestions when I was in a deadlock. Another thanks to Earl Cornell, wo brought a lot of help on technical details. He was always open for an interesting conversation about the implementation of IRENE.

I am also grateful to the Hirschmann Foundation for their generous fellowship which was a great help for my life in the USA.

Finally, many thanks to my parents, family and friends who supported me in this experience and allowed me to keep in touch with my homeland during the semester.
