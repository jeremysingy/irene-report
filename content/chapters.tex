\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Context}

%IRENE and PRISM
For several years, Carl Haber and his team have been working on the sound recovery of old mechanical records. They developed two different systems able to extract the sound without any physical contact, using optical methods. This is an important characteristic as a lot of old records are fragile and could be damaged when read from with a mechanical system.

The first system is called \gls{irene}.

The second TODO.

The aim of this Master thesis is to find ways to read correctly different kinds of degraded records with the solutions developed at LBNL by Carl Haber and his team.

For example, cracked discs is a frequent defect, when the lacquer coating shrinks as the disc is getting old. This causes the groove traces to be separated and makes it difficult for the programs to track them.

TODO end.

% Glossary words test: the \gls{gui} is very useful for \gls{irene}.
